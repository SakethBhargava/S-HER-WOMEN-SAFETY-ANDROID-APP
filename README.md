Woman safety is the most significant and serious issue of contemporary society and demands
effective technological solutions to be invented. Safety and security for women are indispensable for
guaranteeing gender equality, well-being for the individual, and social development. Women are facing
various challenges and dangers in the shape of harassment, violence, discrimination, and unequal
distribution of resources and opportunities. To address these issues, collective action is being taken to raise
awareness, advocate for women's rights, and establish effective measures for women's safety. This includes
education and awareness campaigns that aim to change attitudes and behaviors within society, foster
respectful relationships, and combat gender stereotypes and prejudices.
